5 random genes:
  1. protein refolding molecular co-chaperone Hsp90
    Is a heat-shock protein, ATPase. Is also known as ECK0467; JW0462. The HtpG protein is the Escherichia coli homolog of the ubiquitous HSP90 family of proteins 
    Hsp90 molecular chaperones are needed for many client proteins' stability and activity. Mammalian cells contain three types of Hsp90s: cytosolic Hsp90, mitochondrial Trap-1, and Grp94 of the endoplasmic reticulum.
