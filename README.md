5 random genes:
  1. protein refolding molecular co-chaperone Hsp90
    Is a heat-shock protein, ATPase. Is also known as ECK0467; JW0462. The HtpG protein is the Escherichia coli homolog of the ubiquitous HSP90 family of proteins. Hsp90 molecular chaperones are needed for many client proteins' stability and activity. Mammalian cells contain three types of Hsp90s: cytosolic Hsp90, mitochondrial Trap-1, and Grp94 of the endoplasmic reticulum.
  2. GMP reductase [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]
    Protein coding. GMP reductase is an enzyme that catalyses the irreversible and NADPH-dependent reductive deamination of GMP into IMP.It functions in the conversion of nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of G to A nucleotides, and in maintaining the intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides.
  3. acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]
    A type of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-COAs to the free fatty acid and coenzyme CoASH. Displays high levels of activity on medium and long chain acyl CoAs.It is most active on myristoyl-CoA but also shows high activity on palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, and arachidoyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs also control protein targeting to various membranes and regulation of G Protein Î± subunits, because they are substrates for protein acylation. In the mitochondria, acyl-CoA esters are involved with mitochondrial NAD+ dependent dehydrogenases; because these enzymes are responsible for amino acid catabolism, this acylation renders the whole process inactive. 
  4. succinate dehydrogenase, flavoprotein subunit [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]
